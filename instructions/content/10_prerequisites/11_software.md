Before you begin coding, there are a few things you need to install, update, and configure in the Cloud9 environment.

### Installing and updating

In the Cloud9 terminal, **run the following commands** to install and update some software you'll be using for this workshop:

```bash
# Update the AWS CLI
pip install --user --upgrade awscli

# Install and use Node.js v8.10 (to match AWS Lambda)
nvm install v8.11.0
nvm alias default v8.11.0

# Install the AWS CDK
npm install -g aws-cdk@0.34.0
```

These commands will take a few minutes to finish.

### Configuring a default region

A best practice is to deploy your infrastructure close to your customers, let's configure a default AWS region for this workshop : Northern Virginia (_us-east-1_) for North America or Ireland (_eu-west-1_) for Europe.

**Create an AWS config file**, run the following in the terminal :
{{% notice info %}}
Make sure the regions align, whatever region your running cloud9 in, choose that as your default.
{{% /notice %}}

{{% tabs %}}
{{% tab "us-east-1" "North America" %}}

```bash
cat <<END > ~/.aws/config
[default]
region=us-east-1
END
```

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab  "eu-west-1"  "Europe" %}}

```bash
cat <<END > ~/.aws/config
[default]
region=eu-west-1
END
```

{{% /tab %}}

{{% tab  "ap-southeast-1"  "Singapore" %}}

```bash
cat <<END > ~/.aws/config
[default]
region=ap-southeast-1
END
```

The AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and provision it through AWS CloudFormation. The CDK integrates fully with AWS services and offers a higher level object-oriented abstraction to define AWS resources imperatively. Using the CDKâ€™s library of infrastructure constructs, you can easily encapsulate AWS best practices in your infrastructure definition and share it without worrying about boilerplate logic. The CDK improves the end-to-end development experience because you get to use the power of modern programming languages to define your AWS infrastructure in a predictable and efficient manner.
